# Monoxide

## What is Monoxide?

Monoxide is a MongoDB ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for Rust, inspired by Mongoose. It provides a familiar, schema-based modeling approach for developers who want to work with MongoDB in Rust while benefiting from Rust’s type safety, performance, and async capabilities.

Whether you're transitioning from JavaScript or looking for a structured way to interact with MongoDB in Rust, Monoxide makes database operations more intuitive and efficient.

## Features (MVP)

- Schema-Based Modeling → Define models using Rust structs.

- Async-First → Built with tokio and mongodb for non-blocking execution.

- CRUD Operations → Supports .save(), .find(), .update(), and .delete().

- Basic Validation → Ensures required fields are properly set before saving.

- Error Handling & Logging → Provides structured error messages and logging for better debugging.

## Stay Tuned!

We are actively developing Monoxide and will be adding more features soon. Stay tuned for updates, documentation, and example usage!
